I am a senior iOS Developer with 15 of experience and a trained AI Engineer. 
My expertise includes SwiftUI, Fast API, AWS, Open AI, Prompt Engineering, Bedrock, Pinecone, and others.

Currently, I'm focused on SwiftUI in my day to day professional work in a Fortune 500 company, and building AI systems after work.

I've been involved with apps that gained global traction, including one which became the Best Startup in Tech Crunch.
